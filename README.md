# Palindrome
Palindrome created in Javascript

For this project I created two versions of Palindrome. One is useful to produce a palindrome that may have long strings. The other program is useful for short string. The long string verison does not use  a while loops since it would take too long and not efficient enough. Using a while loops is way more useful for short and quick. The overall view of the code is that it first removes any non letter word and convert all letters into lowercase. THe program will return true as along as the backwards variable is the same as the forward variable.
